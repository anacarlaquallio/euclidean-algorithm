# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Number Theory is a mathematical discipline dedicated to the study of the properties and relationships of integers. Among the fundamental concepts in this field, the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) stands out. An effective approach to computationally calculate the Greatest Common Divisor resides in the Euclidean Algorithm, which employs recursion to progressively simplify the problem until it reduces to a trivial matter. The extended version of the Euclidean Algorithm allows establishing a relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers and their respective linear combinations, through BÃ©zout's Relation. The scope of this study focuses on presenting a new approach to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, determining the coefficients that compose the Greatest Common Divisor through a set of iterations. Thus, the developed method is computationally applied to verify the accuracy of the obtained solutions. This evaluation encompasses elementary cases of the GCD function to scenarios that, following a conventional approach, require multiple recursive calls.
