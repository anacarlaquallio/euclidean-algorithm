# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Authors: Ana Carla Quallio Rosa, Fernando Cézar Gonçalves Manso, Wellington José Corrêa.

The extended version of the Euclidean Algorithm allows the establishment of a relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers and their respective linear combinations through Bézout's Identity. The scope of this study focuses on presenting a novel approach to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, determining the coefficients that form the Greatest Common Divisor through a series of iterations.
